; Pan to Bow, V1.0
;
; http://flickr.com/photos/theilr, (c) 2009
;
; DESCRIPTION: Takes a wide panoramic image and bends it into a
; rainbow-shaped image in a way that preserves scale and aspect ratio.
;
; ONE MOTIVATION: On image hosting sites like flickr, images are
; displayed according to their largest linear dimension, so large
; aspect-ratio shots end up with very little real estate.  By bending
; the image into a semi (or full) circle, you can give your image a
; lot more area of the screen.  Not only that but since the linear
; dimension is smaller, the image details will actually be larger (by
; a factor of as much as pi=3.14159...) when the image is scaled to
; fit within the fixed linear dimension.
;
; USAGE NOTES:
;
; Although the new image keeps the same scale as the original, the
; created image will have a larger number of pixels (because of all
; the empty pixels).
;
; The attempt at non-distortion applies only to the central horizontal
; band of the image; depending on the initial aspect ratio, you will
; see distortion above and below that centerline.  (The larger the
; initial aspect ratio, the smaller the distortion will be.)
;
; This overwrites the current layer.  So you should copy the current
; layer if you want to keep it around.  But since the new layer will
; be of a different size than the current layer, you may prefer to 
; overwrite it.
;
; The part of the image that is outside the original image will be
; white.
;
; BUGS: 
;
; If the aspect ratio isn't wide enough, then aspect ratio cannot
; be preserved.  (This isn't actually a bug, it's basic geometry.)
; In particular, you want width/height > angle / 114.6.
; For instance, for default 180-degree bow, width/height > 1.57
; The program will still "work" in this case, but scale and aspect
; ratio will be compromised.
;
; Because it uses plug-in-polar-coords, it has, as an intermediate
; step, to resize the image, in some cases by quite a large factor.
; (And pan images tend to be pretty large to begin with.)  So there
; could be problems on computers with limited memory.  It might
; have made more sense to just enhance the plug-in directly.
;
; Disabled use of angle<45, since that leads to huge intermediate
; images!
;
; Might be a nice feature to toggle whether the user wants to copy
; the current layer before altering it.
;
; Currently, this tries to maintain scale along the middle of the 
; image; one can imagine situations when it would be preferable to
; keep the scale accurate at the top or the bottom of the image.
;
; I would prefer that the background be transparent instead of white;
; and if I create an image from scratch, and save it as an .xcf file,
; I can get the transparent background.  But when I start with a jpeg
; file, I get a white background.

; TESTING:
; This script was tested with GIMP 2.6.7
